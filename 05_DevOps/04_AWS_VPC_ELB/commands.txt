## CREATE VPC
Virtual Private Cloud
### AWS, VPC, Your VPC. Default already exists. CREATE VPC
Name tag = ecotech-vpc
Give it IPv4 CIDR block = 10.25.0.0/16

**OK**

### CREATE SUBNETS
1. ecotech-**public1** (10.25.1.0/24)
2. ecotech-**public2** (10.25.2.0/24)
3. ecotech-**private1** (10.25.3.0/24)
4. ecotech-**private2** (10.25.4.0/24)

#### first subnet
Name tag = ecotech-public1
VPC = vpc-014a6f20b5557eff6
AZ = us-east-1a
IPv4 CIDR block* = 10.25.1.0/24

### AZs
Availability Zones
us-east-1a
	ecotech-public1 (10.25.1.0/24)
	ecotech-private1 (10.25.3.0/24)

us-east-1b
	ecotech-public2 (10.25.2.0/24)
	ecotech-private2 (10.25.4.0/24)

When you create VPC, it creates a routing table.
Any subnets you create becomes default associated to that VPC's routing table.

Public subnets should be routed through Internet Gateway (IG) 

**OK**

ecotech-private1 should be routed through NAT.

**OK**

## CREATE IG
Internet Gateway
Name tag = ecotech-IG
Now I need to attach it to VPC via menu actions. (each VPC can only have 1 IG)

**OK**

## CREATE NAT Gateway
Network Address Translation
This allows EC2 in private subnet to communicate with internet through NAT.
Bc NAT communicates with outer net, it must be in a public subnet.

**OK**

Subnet = ecotech-public1
Elastic IP Allocation ID = generated on demand
	* Q) Do I need to associate ecotech-public2 with the NAT?*
	* A) Not according to the illustration*

### EDIT NAT ROUTING TABLES
Go to Subnets, select ecotech-public1, go to Route tables, click link, edit routes
Destination = 0.0.0.0/0 to destignate all other traffic routes to IG
Subnet is now public! Even if subnet EC2s are private, they still route through IG
NAT is on ecotech-public1
	* Q) Should I do this for ecotech-public2?*
	* A1) I think so. How else could public2 talk to internet?*
	* A2) When I go into ecotech-public2's route table, I see it already channels everything to IG.* **Good!**	
	
### CREATE ROUTE TABLE FOR PRIVATE NAT
[This](https://youtu.be/hMOwqYO_rAc?t=1034) can serve as reference.
Name tag = ecotech-private-routing-table
This is not the main routing table
Associate it with private subnet, so its explicitly associated with routing table.
private subnet is no longer associated with default routing table.
Next, add a route, to route traffic destined for internet through NAT
Destination = 0.0.0.0/0
Target = NAT gateway
	* Q) Do I need to associate private2 with NAT?*
	* A) Not according to illustration.*

Now we have 2 routing tables.
public subnet associated with main routing table
private subnet associated with private routing table

ecotech-public1 (10.25.1.0/24) NAT
ecotech-public2 (10.25.2.0/24)
ecotech-private1 (10.25.3.0/24) -> NAT
ecotech-private2 (10.25.4.0/24)

**OK!**

**I can access the ec2 webservers, so I think everything up to this point is good!**

## CREATE EC2s
Elastic Compute 2
t2.micro
AMI: ami-3ea13f29 (public community image)

### Config
ecotech-vpc
AZs = [us-east-1a, us-east-1a, us-east-1b]
public IP ENABLE
Name = [ecoweb1, ecoweb2, ecoweb3]
SG name = ecoweb-sg
Port 80 In
Port 22 In on your [IP](http://checkip.amazonaws.com).

ecoweb1 = ecotech-public1, AZ1
ecoweb2 = ecotech-public2, AZ2
ecoweb3 = ecotech-public2, AZ2


**OK!**

## CREATE ELB
Elastic Load Balancer
These direct web traffic round-robin to ec2s.
Guide available [here](https://youtu.be/m7O24xz9LF8?t=542).
Under instances, left pane, Load Balancer
Application Load Balancer
internet-facing
Listener specifies which protocol and port the load balance for will listen for comms on.
Availability Zones = [us-east-1a, us-east-1b]
	*Q) Which subnets to place it on? the two public????*
	*A) both i believe.
SG = ecoweb-sg
target group name = ecotech—webservers
Health checks path = /index.php
register targets = all 3 EC2s

**Note** - DNS name = ecoweb-lb-621869536.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com (A Record)

This endpoint address is used to access the ELB.
The ELB has its own IPs, but they change bc this is a managed service. So, use DNS name.

On left, under Target Groups, you can see tab Targets. Check it out. Wait a minute and error msg goes away.

	*PROBLEM) When I browse to ecoweb-lb-621869536.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
	I get "Hi, I'm instance " and nothing else. It's not round robin.*
	*SOLUTION) Do the recommended fix AND WAIT 10 MINUTES.*
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20941704/ec2-instance-has-no-public-dns

### TEST ELB
Stop the instance, see if round-robin sends visit to the stopped instance. Nope! Restart EC2

**OK**
**I can access the ec2 webservers, so I think everything up to this point is good!**

## CREATE RDS
Amazon Relational Database Service

### Create Subnet for DB
Subnet group name = ecotech-db-subnet-group
Description = Subnet for ecotech database
VPC = echotech-vpc
Add all the subnets related to this VPC
REMOVE from the group
ecotech-public1 = subnet-0815e516c12d6df55
echotech-public2 = subnet-057b2a4945d538f21

### Create RDS instance
db = MySQL RDS
template = free-tier. this has fewer parameters/options to set. same with dev/test tier
name = ecotech-db1
login = admin
pass = nfreka4353$%
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) = echotech-vpc
Public accessibility = Yes
AZ = AZ1.

#### Additional connectivity configuration
##### Security Group
name = ecodb-sg 
allow traffic from the ecoweb-sg webservers to the RDS instance on port 3306 (MySQL)
client app will use port 3306 to connect.
> Change the ecodb-sg security group inbound rules to allow for Source (not IP) ecoweb-sg.

#### Test RDS
SSH into an EC2 and connect to RDS endpoint using,
nc -vz ecotech-db1.cmi0099v8yr5.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com 3306

*PROBLEM) When trying to SSH into EC2, "Please login as the user "ec2-user" rather than the user "root""
*[(SOLUTION)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4230516/sshing-into-ec2-server-via-gives-error-please-login-as-the-ec2-user-user-rather)
change from:
ssh -i "Testin_NVirginia.pem" **root**@ec2-18-232-180-69.compute-1.amazonaws.com
to:
ssh -i "Testin_NVirginia.pem" **ec2-user**@ec2-18-232-180-69.compute-1.amazonaws.com

*PROBLEM) Only ecoweb3 ec2 works...*
*SOLUTION) Recreate EC2s, but with public subnets. Previously, I'd not set the subnets.*

*PROBLEM) nc: connect to ecotech-db1.cmi0099v8yr5.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com port 3306 (tcp) failed: Connection timed out*
nc -vz ecotech-db1.cmi0099v8yr5.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com 3306
*SOLUTION?)* Check the inbound rules in security group for database, named ecodb-sh. I hadn't added SSH port 22!*
*But No difference :(*
*SOLUTION) VPC - ecodb-sg - Inbound Rules - Edit Rules - change MYSQL/Aurora source from the actual IP address to the security group name, e.g. _"sg-078159ca4885de927"_
