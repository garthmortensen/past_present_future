# Autoscaling

## Create Infrastructure

### Create VPC
Name tag = VPC_for_Garth_Inc
IPv4 CIDR block = 10.0.0.0/16

### Create Internet Gateway (IG)
Name tag = IG_for_Garth_Inc
Attach to VPC_for_Garth_Inc

### Create Subnets
_When you create VPC, it creates a routing table. Any subnets you create becomes default associated to that VPC's routing table._

_All instances on the two production subnets will need to be able to communicate with the Internet. You will need to configure the subnets and routing tables in the VPC to allow this communication._

1. First Subnet
Name tag = production-public-1
IPv4 CIDR block = 10.0.1.0/25

2. Second Subnet
Name tag = production-public-2
IPv4 CIDR block = 10.0.1.128/25

### Create Route Table
Name tag = RouteTable_for_Garth_Inc_1

#### Routes
Destination = 0.0.0.0/0
Target = IG_for_Garth_Inc

IS THIS CORRECT???

### Create Security Group (SG)

1. Elastic Load Balancer
Security group name = production-lb
Description = Accept traffic from the Internet and distribute it to web servers.
VPC = the VPC

1. Web
Security group name = production-web
Description = Allow all external devices to communicate with the web server instances via SSH and HTTP
VPC = the VPC
Ingress
SSH allowed from your workstation
HTTP allowed from the Internet

### Create Application Load Balancer (ELB/LB)
_The autoscaling group will deploy multiple web servers into your VPC. You will need an application load balancer to distribute requests to the web servers to ensure that the service is highly available._

Name = web-lb
Protocol = HTTP
Use /index.php as the health check ping path.

ALL GOOD HERE? MANY SETTINGS

#### ELB Target Group
Name = productionWebservers

## Create Servers

### Create AMI

Amazon Linux AMI 64-bit
t2.micro
Network = VPC_for_Garth_Inc
Subnet = production-public-1
Auto-assign public IP = Enable
IAM role = S3-full-access

User data (in Advanced section) (copy paste it in)
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y git httpd php
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
aws s3 cp s3://seis665-public/index.php /var/www/html/

Tag Name = webserver1
Security group = production-web

PROBLEM) When browsing to public IP, I see "Hi, I'm instance" without the instance name.
SOLUTION) As before, do [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20941704/ec2-instance-has-no-public-dns).

#### Create Image
Image name = basicweb
Image description = This is a basic webserver instance

Once it's created, terminate the original EC2.
