# Shared Repo

The purposes of this repository:
  1. Archive work related to Databases, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence Big Data and more. Filetypes span .pdf, .r, .py, .ipynb, .xlsx. Some old R Notebooks weren't playing nicely with Github, but are still available on rpubs.com, [here](https://rpubs.com/GMortensen). Some old Python Notebooks were created at Kaggle.com, which doesn't play nicely with Github. They've been uploaded as .pdf.  
    2. Collection of ongoing work.  
    3. Serve as a code reference for myself to draw from. There are many ways to do the same thing in coding. When I find the simplest and clearest way, I adopt that going forward. 

Enjoy!
