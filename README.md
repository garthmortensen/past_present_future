# Shared Repo
Garth Mortensen

This repository serves several purposes.
  1. Archive of work related to Databases, Data Mining, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Sometimes this is available in the form of .py or .r code, other times as pdf.  
    
    a. Some old R Notebooks weren't playing nicely with Github, but are still available at rpubs.com, [here](https://rpubs.com/GMortensen).  
    
    b. Some old Python Notebooks were created at Kaggle.com, which doesn't play nicely with Github. They've been uploaded as .pdf.  
  
  2. Collection of ongoing work.  
  
Please be gentle, all files were part of a _learning process_.

Enjoy!
