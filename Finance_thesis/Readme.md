This was thesis work for an MSc in Finance. It studies two time-series of stock market indices. But it does so in an abnormal approach.

Returns are not independent and identically distributed. The same cannot be said of prices. In fact, this is the most proven fact in finance. Random Walk Down Wall Street and other classics repeatedly tell a fundamental law of the markets – you can’t predict prices. In physics, the most widely tested and asserted hypothesis is EMC2. In finance, it is that prices are independent and identically distributed processes, or in other words, white noise. Stock brokers employed for the sole purpose of trying to “play the market” could be either uneducated on the matter, a gambler, a fraud, or worse, a denier of science. They’re akin to modern day physicists performing stage acts and accrediting results to the Ether. 

But that’s not the end of investment. Just as you can take the derivative of speed to obtain acceleration, you can take the derivative of price to obtain returns. Returns are, in fact, not independent and identically distributed processes (Alexandre 131 book 2). Therein lies potential for things like GARCH analysis or developing an expertise in volatility.
